PEP- Personal Education Plan

PEP Overview
What is a Personal Education Plan or PEP?
A Personal Education Plan (PEP) is a written plan that indentifies interventions provided to individual students who are at risk of academic failure and not progressing toward promotion and graduation .

When are PEPs developed?
PEP's are developed before or by the end of the first quarter  for students needing them at the beginning of the school year.  A PEP should be 
developed later in the school year if student performance indicates the need.  Staff can work with a student for up to nine weeks before developing a PEP.

Which students should have a PEP?
PEP's are developed for students who have not met or who are not meeting the grade level promotion standards or graduation standards. Typically these are students who are:

    promoted with intervention at the end of the school year. 
    not promoted to the next grade.
    being considered for retention during the third quarter (grades k-8)


How long does a PEP last?
A PEP is a one-year plan that ends at the end of each school year.
